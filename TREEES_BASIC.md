---

### üìå **1. INTRODUCTION TO TREES**

* A **tree** is a **non-linear hierarchical data structure**.
* It consists of **nodes** connected by **edges**.
* **Root**: The topmost node.
* **Leaf**: A node with no children.
* **Parent/Child**: The direct relationship between nodes.
* **Subtree**: A tree formed by a node and its descendants.
* Trees are **acyclic** and **connected** graphs.

### üìê **2. BASIC TERMINOLOGY**

| Term         | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Node**     | A fundamental part of a tree containing data |
| **Edge**     | A link between two nodes                     |
| **Root**     | The top node (entry point)                   |
| **Parent**   | Node with children                           |
| **Child**    | Node derived from a parent                   |
| **Leaf**     | Node without children                        |
| **Siblings** | Nodes sharing the same parent                |
| **Height**   | Longest path from root to a leaf             |
| **Depth**    | Distance from root to a node                 |
| **Degree**   | Number of children a node has                |
| **Level**    | The generation of a node in a tree           |

### üå≤ **3. TYPES OF TREES**

#### A. **General Trees**

* No restriction on number of children.
* Used in generic hierarchies.

---

#### B. **Binary Trees**

* Each node has **at most 2 children**.
* Common base for many tree variations.

##### Types of Binary Trees:

| Type                     | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Binary Tree**     | Every node has 0 or 2 children                                    |
| **Perfect Binary Tree**  | All internal nodes have 2 children & all leaves are at same level |
| **Complete Binary Tree** | All levels filled except possibly the last (filled left to right) |
| **Skewed Tree**          | All nodes have only left or right child (left/right skewed)       |
| **Balanced Binary Tree** | Height of left and right subtrees differ by at most 1             |

---

#### C. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

* Left child < Parent < Right child.
* Efficient for **search, insert, delete** operations: **O(log n)** (average case).

##### BST Operations:

* Insert
* Search
* Delete (3 cases: no child, 1 child, 2 children)

---

#### D. **AVL Tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree)**

* **Self-balancing BST**
* Balance factor of each node = height(left) - height(right) ‚àà {-1, 0, 1}
* **Rotations** (LL, RR, LR, RL) used to maintain balance

---

#### E. **Red-Black Tree**

* Self-balancing BST with **color rules**:

  * Root is black.
  * Red node can't have red child.
  * Every path from node to descendant leaf has same number of black nodes.
* Used in **Linux kernel**, **map/set in C++ STL**

---

#### F. **Segment Tree**

* For **range queries** and **updates** (e.g., sum, min, max in range).
* Time complexity:

  * Build: O(n)
  * Query/Update: O(log n)

---

#### G. **Fenwick Tree / Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**

* Used for **prefix sum** and **range queries**.
* Efficient and compact, less memory than Segment Tree.
* Time complexity:

  * Update/Query: O(log n)

---

#### H. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**

* For **string-based data**.
* Used in autocomplete, spell checking.
* Nodes store **characters**, paths represent **words**.
* Operations: insert, search, delete ‚Üí O(L), where L = length of word.

---

#### I. **Heap Tree**

* **Binary Heap**: Complete binary tree with Heap Property:

  * **Max Heap**: Parent ‚â• children
  * **Min Heap**: Parent ‚â§ children
* Used in **Priority Queues**, **Heap Sort**

---

#### J. **B-Tree**

* Used in **databases & file systems**.
* Generalization of BST: Each node has more than two children.
* Balanced, high fan-out (less height).

---

#### K. **B+ Tree**

* Like B-Tree, but only **leaf nodes contain data**.
* Internal nodes only store keys.
* Used in **DBMS indexing**.

---

#### L. **N-ary Tree**

* Each node has **at most N children**.
* General form of a tree with more branching.

---

#### M. **Suffix Tree**

* For efficient **string pattern matching**.
* Built from all suffixes of a string.
* Used in bioinformatics, compression, etc.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **4. TREE TRAVERSALS**

#### A. **Depth-First Traversal**

* **Inorder (LNR)**: Left ‚Üí Node ‚Üí Right
* **Preorder (NLR)**: Node ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Right
* **Postorder (LRN)**: Left ‚Üí Right ‚Üí Node

#### B. **Breadth-First Traversal**

* Level Order Traversal (uses Queue)
