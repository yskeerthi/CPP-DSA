In C++, a **stack** is a data structure that operates on a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means that the last element inserted (pushed) into the stack is the first one to be removed (popped) from it. Stacks are used in many areas, such as managing function calls (call stack), parsing expressions, undo mechanisms in text editors, and many more.

### C++ Standard Template Library (STL) Stack
C++ provides a built-in stack class in the Standard Template Library (STL) under the `<stack>` header. The `std::stack` is a container adaptor that gives the programmer the functionality of a stack (LIFO).

### Stack Operations
A stack supports the following basic operations:

1. **push(element)**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **pop()**: Removes the top element from the stack.
3. **top()**: Returns the top element without removing it.
4. **empty()**: Checks if the stack is empty.
5. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

### Example of a Stack in C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    std::stack<int> myStack;

    // Push elements onto the stack
    myStack.push(10);
    myStack.push(20);
    myStack.push(30);

    // Check the top element
    std::cout << "Top element: " << myStack.top() << std::endl;  // Output: 30

    // Remove (pop) the top element
    myStack.pop();
    std::cout << "Top element after pop: " << myStack.top() << std::endl;  // Output: 20

    // Check if stack is empty
    if (myStack.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Stack is empty" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Stack size: " << myStack.size() << std::endl;  // Output: 2
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Creating a Stack**: 
   ```cpp
   std::stack<int> myStack;
   ```
   This creates a stack of integers named `myStack`.

2. **push()**: 
   ```cpp
   myStack.push(10);
   myStack.push(20);
   myStack.push(30);
   ```
   Three elements (10, 20, and 30) are pushed onto the stack, where 30 is the top element.

3. **top()**: 
   ```cpp
   std::cout << "Top element: " << myStack.top() << std::endl;
   ```
   This returns the element at the top of the stack, which is 30, without removing it.

4. **pop()**: 
   ```cpp
   myStack.pop();
   ```
   This removes the top element (30). Now, 20 is at the top.

5. **empty()** and **size()**: 
   ```cpp
   myStack.empty();
   myStack.size();
   ```
   The `empty()` function checks if the stack is empty, and `size()` returns the number of elements currently in the stack.

### Key Points
- **LIFO structure**: The most recent element is accessed first.
- **Container adaptability**: The `stack` in C++ is built on top of other container classes like `vector`, `deque`, or `list`. By default, it uses `deque`.
- **No random access**: Unlike arrays or vectors, you canâ€™t access elements by index in a stack; you can only access the topmost element.
