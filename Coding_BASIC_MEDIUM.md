Understood! I'll start with the answers and explanations for **Data Types & Variables** (basic level). Here's how the structure will look for each topic:

---

### **Topic: Data Types & Variables (Basic Level)**

**Question 1:**  
Write a program to declare an integer, a float, and a character variable and print them.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int integerVar = 10;
    float floatVar = 3.14;
    char charVar = 'A';
    
    cout << "Integer: " << integerVar << endl;
    cout << "Float: " << floatVar << endl;
    cout << "Character: " << charVar << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program declares three variables—`integerVar`, `floatVar`, and `charVar`—of types integer, float, and character, respectively. It then prints them using `cout`. The output will be:
```
Integer: 10
Float: 3.14
Character: A
```

---

**Question 2:**  
Write a program to swap two integer variables using a third variable.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10, temp;
    
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;

    cout << "After swapping: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
Here, we use a temporary variable `temp` to hold the value of `a`, swap `a` with `b`, and assign the value in `temp` to `b`. After swapping, `a = 10` and `b = 5`. The output will be:
```
After swapping: a = 10, b = 5
```

---

**Question 3:**  
Write a program to demonstrate the use of a constant variable.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    const int constantVar = 100;
    cout << "Constant value: " << constantVar << endl;

    // constantVar = 200; // This line would cause an error

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
In this program, `constantVar` is declared as a constant using the `const` keyword. Trying to modify it (uncommenting `constantVar = 200`) would result in a compilation error because constants cannot be changed. The output will be:
```
Constant value: 100
```

---

**Question 4:**  
Write a program to take input of an integer and a float from the user and print their sum.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int integerVar;
    float floatVar;

    cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    cin >> integerVar;

    cout << "Enter a float: ";
    cin >> floatVar;

    float sum = integerVar + floatVar;

    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program uses `cin` to take input for an integer and a float, calculates their sum, and prints it. If the user enters `5` and `2.5`, the output will be:
```
Sum: 7.5
```

---

**Question 5:**  
Write a program to check if a number is odd or even.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num;

    cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    cin >> num;

    if (num % 2 == 0) {
        cout << num << " is even." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << num << " is odd." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program checks if the number is divisible by 2 (using the modulus operator `%`). If `num % 2 == 0`, the number is even, otherwise it's odd. For input `4`, the output will be:
```
4 is even.
```

---

**Question 6:**  
Write a program to calculate the size of different data types in C++.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of float: " << sizeof(float) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of double: " << sizeof(double) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of char: " << sizeof(char) << " bytes" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program uses the `sizeof` operator to determine and print the size of various data types in bytes. The typical output will be:
```
Size of int: 4 bytes
Size of float: 4 bytes
Size of double: 8 bytes
Size of char: 1 byte
```

---

Great! Let's continue with **Data Types & Variables (Medium Level)**. I’ll first provide the medium-level questions, answers, and explanations for this topic.

---

### **Topic: Data Types & Variables (Medium Level)**

**Question 1:**  
Write a program to swap two integer variables without using a third variable.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10;

    // Swapping without a third variable
    a = a + b;  // a now becomes 15
    b = a - b;  // b becomes 5 (original value of a)
    a = a - b;  // a becomes 10 (original value of b)

    cout << "After swapping: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
In this program, we swap the values of `a` and `b` without using a third variable. By using arithmetic operations, we first add `a` and `b` to make `a` hold their sum, then adjust `b` and `a` accordingly to swap their values. The output will be:
```
After swapping: a = 10, b = 5
```

---

**Question 2:**  
Write a program to take an integer, a float, and a double as input and print their sum in both float and double format.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int intVar;
    float floatVar;
    double doubleVar;

    cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    cin >> intVar;

    cout << "Enter a float: ";
    cin >> floatVar;

    cout << "Enter a double: ";
    cin >> doubleVar;

    // Calculate the sum
    float sumFloat = intVar + floatVar + doubleVar;
    double sumDouble = intVar + floatVar + doubleVar;

    cout << "Sum as float: " << sumFloat << endl;
    cout << "Sum as double: " << sumDouble << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
In this program, we take inputs of different types (integer, float, and double) and compute the sum in both float and double formats. It shows how the sum is affected when using different precision levels. If inputs are `2`, `3.5`, and `4.12345`, the output will be:
```
Sum as float: 9.62345
Sum as double: 9.62345
```

---

**Question 3:**  
Write a program to calculate the sum of two integers, without using the `+` operator.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 15, b = 25;

    while (b != 0) {
        int carry = a & b;
        a = a ^ b;
        b = carry << 1;
    }

    cout << "Sum: " << a << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program uses bitwise operators to add two integers without using the `+` operator. The idea is based on the binary addition of numbers, where `^` performs addition without considering carry and `&` followed by left shift handles the carry part. The output will be:
```
Sum: 40
```

---

**Question 4:**  
Write a program to demonstrate type casting between an integer and a double, and explain the result.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int integerVar = 5;
    double doubleVar = 3.14;

    // Implicit type casting (int to double)
    double result = integerVar + doubleVar;

    // Explicit type casting (double to int)
    int castedResult = (int)doubleVar;

    cout << "Result of implicit casting (int to double): " << result << endl;
    cout << "Result of explicit casting (double to int): " << castedResult << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program demonstrates two types of casting:  
- **Implicit casting** happens automatically when the compiler converts the integer `integerVar` to double for the operation.  
- **Explicit casting** is done manually when the double value `doubleVar` is cast to an integer. The output will be:
```
Result of implicit casting (int to double): 8.14
Result of explicit casting (double to int): 3
```

---

**Question 5:**  
Write a program to take a character as input and print its ASCII value.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char character;

    cout << "Enter a character: ";
    cin >> character;

    cout << "ASCII value of " << character << " is: " << int(character) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program takes a character as input and prints its ASCII value by converting the character to an integer using `int()`. If the user enters `A`, the output will be:
```
ASCII value of A is: 65
```

---

Let's proceed with **I/O Streams & Operators**. I'll begin with the **basic-level questions**, followed by their answers and explanations. After that, I’ll provide the **medium-level questions** with answers.

---

### **Topic: I/O Streams & Operators (Basic Level)**

**Question 1:**  
Write a program to take two integer inputs from the user and print their sum.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;

    cout << "Enter first integer: ";
    cin >> a;
    
    cout << "Enter second integer: ";
    cin >> b;

    int sum = a + b;

    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program uses the `cin` stream to take two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum using the `+` operator. If the user enters `3` and `4`, the output will be:
```
Sum: 7
```

---

**Question 2:**  
Write a program to read a character from the user and print it.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char character;

    cout << "Enter a character: ";
    cin >> character;

    cout << "You entered: " << character << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
The program takes a single character input using `cin` and prints it using `cout`. If the user enters `X`, the output will be:
```
You entered: X
```

---

**Question 3:**  
Write a program to demonstrate the use of the addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`) operators.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 5;

    int sum = x + y;
    int diff = x - y;

    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Difference: " << diff << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program shows how to use the `+` and `-` operators for addition and subtraction. The output will be:
```

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 8, b = 2;

    int product = a * b;
    int quotient = a / b;

    cout << "Product: " << product << endl;
    cout << "Quotient: " << quotient << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program demonstrates the use of `*` for multiplication and `/` for division. The output will be:
```
Product: 16
Quotient: 4
```

---

**Question 5:**  
Write a program to demonstrate the use of the modulus operator (`%`).

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1 = 10, num2 = 3;

    int remainder = num1 % num2;

    cout << "Remainder: " << remainder << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program uses the `%` operator to find the remainder when `10` is divided by `3`. The output will be:
```
Remainder: 1
```

---

**Question 6:**  
Write a program to demonstrate the use of the increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 5;

    cout << "Original value of x: " << x << endl;
    cout << "Value after increment: " << ++x << endl;
    cout << "Value after decrement: " << --x << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program demonstrates the use of the increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators. First, `x` is incremented and then decremented. The output will be:
```

Now, let's move on to the **medium-level questions** for **I/O Streams & Operators**.

---

### **Topic: I/O Streams & Operators (Medium Level)**

**Question 1:**  
Write a program to swap two floating-point numbers using the multiplication and division operators.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float a = 5.5, b = 2.5;

    a = a * b;  // a = 13.75
    b = a / b;  // b = 5.5 (original value of a)
    a = a / b;  // a = 2.5 (original value of b)

    cout << "After swapping: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program swaps two floating-point numbers without using a third variable, but instead using multiplication and division operations. The output will be:
```
After swapping: a = 2.5, b = 5.5
```

---

**Question 2:**  
Write a program to read three integers from the user and print the maximum of the three using the ternary (`?:`) operator.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b, c;

    cout << "Enter three integers: ";
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    int max = (a > b) ? ((a > c) ? a : c) : ((b > c) ? b : c);

    cout << "The maximum number is: " << max << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program reads three integers from the user and finds the maximum using nested ternary operators. If the inputs are `3`, `7`, and `5`, the output will be:
```
The maximum number is: 7
```

---

**Question 3:**  
Write a program to read an integer from the user and check if it is a palindrome using only operators.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num, reversedNum = 0, originalNum, remainder;

    cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    cin >> num;

    originalNum = num;

    while (num != 0) {
        remainder = num % 10;
        reversedNum = reversedNum * 10 + remainder;
        num /= 10;
    }

    if (originalNum == reversedNum)
        cout << originalNum << " is a palindrome." << endl;
    else
        cout << originalNum << " is not a palindrome." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program checks whether the given number is a palindrome by reversing the number and comparing it with the original. If the input is `121`, the output will be:
```
121 is a palindrome.
```

---

**Question 4:**  
Write a program to calculate the average of five numbers using the compound assignment operator (`+=`).

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int count = 5;
    float num, sum = 0;

    cout << "Enter 5 numbers: " << endl;

    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        cin >> num;
        sum += num;
    }

    float average = sum / count;

    cout << "Average: " << average << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program calculates the sum of five numbers using the compound assignment operator (`+=`) and then computes the average. If the inputs are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`, the output will be:
```
Average: 3
```

---

**Question 5:**  
Write a program to demonstrate the use of the bitwise AND (`&`) and OR (`|`) operators.

**Answer:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 3;

    cout << "Bitwise AND (5 & 3): " << (a & b) << endl;
    cout << "Bitwise OR (5 | 3): " << (a | b) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This program uses the bitwise AND and OR operators on `5` and `3`. The binary representation of `5` is `101` and `3` is `011`. The output will be:
```
Bitwise AND (5 & 3): 1
Bitwise OR (5 | 3): 7
```
I’ll now proceed with the remaining topics. I'll cover both basic and medium-level questions for each topic, just like we did for **I/O Streams & Operators**.
